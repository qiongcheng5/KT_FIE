# KT²: Knowledge-Tree-based Knowledge Tracing

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper:

[**A Hierarchical Probabilistic Framework for Incremental Knowledge Tracing in Classroom Settings**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09393)

This framework introduces a probabilistic approach that models student knowledge over a structured KC tree, with support for real-time updates via expectation-maximization (EM) and graph-based propagation. The method is designed for classroom scenarios and emphasizes interpretability, modularity, and incremental updates.

## Installation

To install dependencies:

```
conda create -n kt2 python=3.10
conda activate kt2
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Build the Knowledge Graph

To build and prune the KC graph for a given dataset:

```
python scripts/init_graph.py --dataset DATASET_NAME
```

This will load data from `data/dataset/DATASET_NAME/` and save the KC tree template to `data/KC_tree/DATASET_NAME/`.

### 2. Run the KT² Algorithm

Once the graph is ready, run the full knowledge tracing pipeline:

```
python scripts/run_KT2.py
```

Paths and parameters can be configured in `config/config.yaml`. To run the experiment of each classroom setting, set `dataset` as `XES3G5M` or `MOOCRadar`. Set `root_node` as `Application_Module`/`Computation_Module`/`Counting_Module` for XES3G5M; `Wine_Knowledge`/`Circuit_Design`/`Education_Theory` for MOOCRadar.
